# Flight-Data-Analyzer
This is a Python-based application that ingests live flight telemetry from the OpenSky Network API, stores it in a SQLite database, and applies machine learning (Isolation Forest) to detect unusual climb and descent patterns. It also generates interactive flight maps with Plotly to visualize real-time aircraft positions, speeds, and altitudes.
